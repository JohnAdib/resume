I have an important strength that if you ask any of my friends I think it's the first thing they mention. When I look for something, I get it.

I saw in the text of your email that you mentioned the word ambitious. This is also one of my strengths.

I learn quickly and I love learning.

As a weakness, I can point out that I will never give up. Sometimes I lose a lot of time because of this. Just tell me one thing, that you can not do something and then you have to see what happens. Of course, I'm working on it.
