Hello. nice to meet you
I am Javad. A full stack engineer.

About 15 years ago, when I went to university, I always had a problem with reserving food in the university. The capacity was always full. That's why one night I said I have to solve this problem. So I was on the system until tomorrow afternoon and I wrote a robot that would go and reserve food for me.

That's how I got to know PHP. I worked with a lot of languages these years but PHP has been one of my favorite programming languages ever since.

Much of my experience has come from working with professionals and my friends and teamwork. I like to learn and the most important thing is that I learned how to learn. So I do not worry about what you are looking for or what technology you are using now. Just say the word and I will learn it in a short time.

I have always been interested in sharing my skills. That's why I published a variety of tutorials for free, with the help of which thousands of people have reached their favorite jobs.

I think a good job should give me enough passion to improve my skills while helping the company grow.
