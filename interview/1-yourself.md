Hello. nice to meet you
I am Javad. A full stack engineer.

About 15 years ago, when I moved to a new city for university, I got my first job on the web. Designing a WordPress website. In those years, I designed more than 40 websites. Of course, before university, I used to program Windows with c# and vb.

After university, due to working with many programming languages, some of which I didn't even mention in my resume, I practically became a full stack developer. But in my last two jobs, even though I am full stack, my focus was more on the frontend.

In recent years, I have especially focused on clean coding and improving my skills and learning more deeply.

Much of my experience has come from working with professionals and my friends and teamwork. I like to learn and the most important thing is that I learned how to learn. So I do not worry about what you are looking for or what technology you are using now. Just say the word and I will learn it in a short time.

I have always been interested in sharing my skills. That's why I published a variety of tutorials for free, with the help of which thousands of people have reached their favorite jobs.

I think a good job should give me enough passion to improve my skills while helping the company grow.
