Hello. nice to meet you
I put the interview date close to your birthday to say happy birthday..
I am Javad. A full stack computer engineer.

I became familiar with PHP about 14 years ago when I wanted to write a bot to automatically reserve the foods that I liked on campus. PHP has been one of my favorite programming languages ever since.

Much of my experience has come from working with professionals and my friends and teamwork. I like to learn and the most important thing is that I learned how to learn. So I do not worry about what you are looking for or what technology you are using now. Just say the name of the technology or language and I will learn it in a short time.

I have always been interested in sharing my skills. That's why I published a variety of tutorials for free, with the help of which thousands of people have reached their favorite jobs.
